# Project 3 

Wordle Solver 

Takes in a list of 5 letter inputs. For each input, the solver will display its subsequent guesses in the same layout as the actual Wordle game (ie green box for correct guess, yellow box for correct letter wrong spot, and grey for incorrect letter for each position). At the end of all guesses, it will display a summary that displays the number of guesses needed for each input as well as the overall average guesses the solver takes. 

My idea is to use some form of machine learning to train an algorithm to formulate a best initial guess as well as the best approach to minimize the number of overall guesses. The task should be achievable as there is a set number of five letter words that the actual Wordle game pulls from.
